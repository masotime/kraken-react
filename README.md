Isomorphic React with Kraken / Dust

This module is the result of an approach to re-thinking React / isomorphism in Kraken, reconciling with Dust and trying to use React as a component librrary. Most examples on the internet implement isomorphic React as a all-or-nothing solution, where the entire view is rendered using React.

I feel this eliminates one of the key advantages of React - the pluggability just about anywhere. It's a bit challenging using a piecemeal / selective form of React with Kraken's somewhat opinionated slant towards Dust, but it is doable, and requires a bit of discipline.
